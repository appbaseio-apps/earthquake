### Configure

The ReactiveMaps and ReactiveSearch components code resides in `src/App.js` file. For building this app, we use:

1.  [appbase.io](https://appbase.io) for the backend, any Elasticsearch cluster/index should work.
2.  A simple flex based layout system, you can use Materialize's or Bootstrap's grid, or roll your own layout - the ReactiveSearch components are layout agnostic.
3.  The following components:

* **ReactiveBase** - Provider component that connects the UI with the backend app.
* **SingleList** - Creates a single selection based list UI component that is connected to a database field.
* **SelectedFilters** - Creates a selectable filter UI view displaying the current selected values from other components.
* **ReactiveMap** - Creates a data-driven map UI component. It is the key component for build map based experiences.
